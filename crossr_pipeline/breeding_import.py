"""Load The Jockey Club breeding reports in live_foal_statistics/ into breeding_seasons.

Files: "Live Foal Statistics --- YYYY Breeding Season _ ...csv" or
"Report of Mares Bred --- YYYY Breeding Season.csv". When a year has both, the
Live Foal Statistics file wins (it adds reports received and live foals).

Like sales-import: each file is hashed into crossr_pipeline_files (path
prefixed "live_foal_statistics/"); a new or changed file replaces that year's
rows in one transaction; a year already loaded before hashes were kept is
adopted without a reload.
